    <h1>Privacy Policy for Revi: Manga/Manhwa Reader App</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: August 5, 2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Revi, a Manga/Manhwa reader app. This Privacy Policy is
      designed to help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard your
      information when you use our app.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Revi is designed with your privacy in mind and collects minimal personal
      information. We collect:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <strong>Feedback:</strong> Information that you voluntarily provide
        through feedback forms in the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Logs:</strong> Anonymous logs of your app usage from launch
        until feedback submission, including interactions with features. You
        have the option to include these logs with your feedback when you submit
        it. The choice to include or exclude logs is entirely up to you.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      By submitting feedback and logs, you acknowledge that you have reviewed
      the data you provide and confirm that it does not include sensitive
      personal information. Any inclusion of such data is your responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not collect or process sensitive personal data such as health
      information, financial details, or biometric data.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve the app's functionality and user experience</li>
      <li>Implement new features based on user recommendations</li>
      <li>Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We do not share any user data with third parties. Revi operates
      independently and does not collect user data from any external sources.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Feedback and logs are stored anonymously and cannot be traced back to
      individual users. We use Supabase for data hosting, which employs its own
      security measures to protect stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      While we do not collect personal data that can be attributed to individual
      users, we respect your privacy rights. If your country's laws permit, you
      may request:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to your data</li>
      <li>Deletion of your data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that due to the anonymous nature of our data collection, we
      may not be able to identify specific user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Revi requires permission to read and write to your device's storage. This
      is necessary for features such as saving chapters and continuing from the
      last read chapter. You can manage these permissions through your device
      settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Age Restrictions</h2>
    <p>
      Revi is intended for users aged 13 and above. If you are under 13, please
      do not use the app or submit any information to us.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    <p>
      Revi uses various third-party libraries to provide its functionality.
      While we have chosen libraries that do not automatically collect data,
      users should be aware that the app's framework and certain features rely
      on external code.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users
      of any significant changes within the app. Your continued use of Revi
      after such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the
      modified Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>

      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our
      data practices, please contact us at:

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Revi is committed to upholding user privacy and strives to align with
      general privacy principles. However, privacy laws differ across
      jurisdictions, and we cannot ensure compliance with every local regulation
      globally. Users are responsible for determining if their use of Revi
      complies with relevant local laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Revi, you agree to this Privacy Policy and acknowledge that your
      use is subject to its terms. We are not liable for privacy compliance
      beyond the scope of this policy.
